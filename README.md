# Writing-a-Data-Scientist-Blog-Post

## Motivation
In this repository you'll find further information on my Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis. It refers to my first blog post on MEDIA as a contribution to my Data Scientist class at Udacity's.

## Package versions
numpy				1.24.3
pandas				1.5.3
matplotlib			3.7.1
matplotlib-inline	0.1.6
seaborn				0.12.2

## Files
There are three three csv files that contain the Seattle Airbnb Data i want to analyze. Also there is a Jupyter Notebook file in which i show my analysis process in form of a CRISP-DM process.

## Results
We couldn't find any influences on price by host related features, review scores or availability. There are other obvious factors for price like sqauremeters and location. Although we didn't research the influence of those factors, we can assume that these are the main factors for pricing. What we did find is that the mentioned features influence number of reviews.
What the data cannot tell us is how the examined features have an impact on booking fequency of a given home. One can imagine that more information and higher review scores influence Airbnb clients towards booking.
